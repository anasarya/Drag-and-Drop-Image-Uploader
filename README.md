# Drag-and-Drop-Image-Uploader
This project is a modern image uploader web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to drag &amp; drop or click to upload image files with real-time upload progress simulation, image preview, and localStorage persistence. The UI uses a glassmorphism transparent background with smooth animations and an eye-catching design.
